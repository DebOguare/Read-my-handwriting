# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Python and TensorFlow
## This project demonstrates the implementation of a handwritten digit recognition system using Python and TensorFlow. The system leverages deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Features of the Project
- Dataset: The MNIST dataset, consisting of 12 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0â€“9), is used.
- Model Architecture: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is built using TensorFlow and Keras to accurately classify digits.
- Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, and its performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy.
- Interactive Prediction: The trained model can be used to predict digits from new handwritten input.

## How to Set Up the Handwritten Digit Recognition System
1. Install Python and Required Libraries
   - Download and install python 3.9+ and libraries such as tensorflow, keras, matplotlib and numpy
2. Clone repository on local machine using git.
3. Create a project directory.
4. Prepare the dataset
   - create a small collection of handwritting data using paint
   - save the data in a folder.
5. Implement the digit recognition script.
6. Run the script.
7. Visualize result.

## Limitations
1. Extensive training is required for higher accuracy, which can be computationally intensive.

## How It Works
1. Data Preprocessing: The images are normalized to simplify training, and labels are one-hot encoded for classification.
2. Model Training: The CNN learns patterns from the training data to distinguish between digits.
3. Digit Recognition: The trained model predicts the class (digit) of unseen input images.
